# Value-type and solid brush marshalling

Avalonia geometry value types cross the nano-COM ABI **by value** as blittable,
sequential structs instead of as COM objects. This keeps `Margin`, `Padding`,
`BorderThickness`, `CornerRadius` and friends cheap to read and write, and it
avoids a COM object per rectangle. Brushes are the one chrome member that is
*not* a value type: they cross as a small read-only COM interface that carries a
solid colour and an opacity. `Grid`'s track definitions are the one member that
crosses as a **string**: they use the same comma-separated length list Avalonia
already parses and prints (see [Grid track definitions](#grid-track-definitions)).

## Nullable safe inputs

Nullable interface-valued setters and builders accept `Option`: pass
`Some(&control)` to assign a control, or `None` to clear it. Root-control
properties accept `Option<&dyn AsControl>`; more specific interfaces accept
`Option<&SpecificType>`. Nonnullable interface properties still require a value.
For example, `button.set_content(None)?` clears the button's content.

String method inputs accept `impl AsRef<str>` when required and `Option<&str>`
when nullable. The generated wrapper keeps null-terminated UTF-16 buffers alive
through the ABI call; `None` remains a null pointer, distinct from an empty string.

## The structs

Every struct is `LayoutKind.Sequential` / `#[repr(C)]`, contains only `double`
(`f64`) or `uint32_t` (`u32`) fields, and therefore has an identical layout in
the C header, the C# host, and Rust.

| `MarshallingKind` | CLR type               | ABI struct        | Safe Rust type | Fields (in order)                          | Size |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---- |
| `Thickness`       | `Avalonia.Thickness`   | `AvnThickness`    | `Thickness`    | `left`, `top`, `right`, `bottom`           | 32   |
| `CornerRadius`    | `Avalonia.CornerRadius`| `AvnCornerRadius` | `CornerRadius` | `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_right`, `bottom_left` | 32 |
| `Size`            | `Avalonia.Size`        | `AvnSize`         | `Size`         | `width`, `height`                          | 16   |
| `Point`           | `Avalonia.Point`       | `AvnPoint`        | `Point`        | `x`, `y`                                   | 16   |
| `Rect`            | `Avalonia.Rect`        | `AvnRect`         | `Rect`         | `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`                | 32   |
| `Color`           | `Avalonia.Media.Color` | `AvnColor`        | `Color`        | `argb` (packed `u32`)                      | 4    |

`AvnColor` carries a single packed **ARGB** integer that matches
`Avalonia.Media.Color.ToUInt32()` exactly: `(A << 24) | (R << 16) | (G << 8) | B`.
The safe Rust `Color` splits it back into `a`, `r`, `g`, `b` bytes; converting in
either direction is lossless.

## Where each declaration comes from

Everything is generated from the shared projection IR by
`rust/regenerate-and-build.ps1`:

- `projection/Avalonia.Projection.Ir/GeometryMarshalling.cs` is the managed source of
  truth (kind, CLR type, ABI name, field list, conversion style).
- `projection/Avalonia.Projection.Ir/BrushMarshalling.cs` is the equivalent for the
  solid brush interface (CLR types, ABI interface name, factory method name).
- `ComSourceEmitter` writes the C# structs into
  `host/Generated/ObjectModel/ProjectionStructs.g.cs`, each with
  `FromAvalonia`/`ToAvalonia` helpers, and the brush interface plus its
  `AvnBrush` wrapper into `IAvnBrush.g.cs`.
- `NativeHeaderEmitter` writes the `typedef struct Avn*` declarations into
  `rust/avalonia-sys/include/avalonia-rust-abi.h`.
- `rust/avalonia-bindgen/src/geometry.rs` is the Rust-side source of truth; it
  emits the `#[repr(C)]` structs into `avalonia-sys` and the ergonomic structs
  with `From`/`Into` bridges into the safe `avalonia` crate.

## ABI shape in vtables

A projected property of a geometry kind occupies the usual pair of slots and
passes the struct by value on the way in and by pointer on the way out:

```c
AvnHResult (AVN_CALL *get_margin)(IAvnControl* self, AvnThickness* value);
AvnHResult (AVN_CALL *set_margin)(IAvnControl* self, AvnThickness value);
```

## Layout members

The layout wave allowlists the first live geometry-carrying members, alongside
the scalar and enum layout members that belong with them:

| Projected interface | Members |
| ------------------- | ------- |
| `IAvnStyledElement` | `Name` (`string?`) |
| `IAvnControl`       | `Margin` (`Thickness`), `HorizontalAlignment`, `VerticalAlignment`, `MinWidth`, `MinHeight`, `MaxWidth`, `MaxHeight`, `IsVisible`, `Opacity` |
| `IAvnDecorator`     | `Padding` (`Thickness`) |
| `IAvnWindow`        | `CanResize`, `WindowState` |

`Avalonia.Controls.Control` has no `Padding`, so `Padding` sits on `Decorator`
(and therefore on `Border`), matching Avalonia's own hierarchy. Width and Height
were already on `Control`, so `Window` inherits them.

`HorizontalAlignment`, `VerticalAlignment` and `WindowState` are carried as
`int32_t` and projected into the safe crate as Rust enums with `TryFrom<i32>`.

In safe Rust each member is a `set_*`/`get_*` pair plus a chaining builder, and
`Thickness` gains `const` helpers so a caller never repeats a scalar:

```rust
let readout = TextBlock::new()?
    .text("Laid out from Rust")?
    .margin(Thickness::symmetric(12.0, 4.0))?
    .horizontal_alignment(HorizontalAlignment::Right)?
    .max_width(320.0)?;
readout.set_margin(Thickness::uniform(8.0))?;
```

`Thickness::uniform`, `Thickness::symmetric` and `CornerRadius::uniform` are
emitted from the `helpers` column of `avalonia-bindgen`'s geometry table, so a
new geometry struct opts into them declaratively.

## Solid brushes

`IBrush` is an interface, not a value type, and a real brush graph (gradient
stops, tile modes, drawings, visuals) has no blittable shape. Rather than
project that graph, the ABI projects the one case that chrome actually needs: a
**solid colour**.

`MarshallingKind.Brush` maps `Avalonia.Media.IBrush` onto a single generated COM
interface:

```c
struct IAvnBrushVtbl {
    /* IUnknown slots 0-2 */
    AvnHResult (AVN_CALL *get_color)(IAvnBrush* self, AvnColor* value);   /* slot 3 */
    AvnHResult (AVN_CALL *get_opacity)(IAvnBrush* self, double* value);   /* slot 4 */
};
```

`IAvnBrush` is deliberately **read-only**. The managed side hands out immutable
brushes that several controls may share, so a setter would let one caller repaint
another control. A brush is instead minted by the factory, which appends one slot:

```c
AvnHResult (AVN_CALL *create_solid_color_brush)(
    IAvnControlFactory* self, AvnColor color, double opacity, IAvnBrush** value);
```

Unlike the `create_*` control slots it has no dispatcher affinity, so it does not
verify UI-thread access.

### What crosses, and what fails

| Managed value                                   | `get_*`                                 | `set_*` |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `null`                                          | `S_OK`, null pointer                    | clears the property |
| `ISolidColorBrush` (including `SolidColorBrush`) | `S_OK`, colour + opacity                | writes an `ImmutableSolidColorBrush` |
| gradient / drawing / visual brush                | `AVN_E_NONSOLIDBRUSH` (`0xA7A70002`)    | unreachable — the ABI cannot express one |

Reading a non-solid brush fails explicitly rather than degrading to a "nearest"
colour, because a silently wrong colour is worse than an error a caller can act
on. Inbound, every brush is materialised as
`Avalonia.Media.Immutable.ImmutableSolidColorBrush(color, opacity)`, so a set is
always a solid brush by construction and anything a source brush carried beyond
colour and opacity (transforms, gradient stops) is dropped rather than guessed.

Gradients, `DrawingBrush` and `VisualBrush` are out of scope for this ABI. A
future wave that needs them must add a separately named, separately versioned
interface rather than widening `IAvnBrush`.

In safe Rust the brush is a plain value; only crossing the ABI needs the factory:

```rust
let accent = Brush::solid(Color::rgb(0x00, 0x7A, 0xCC));
let card = Border::new()?
    .background(accent)?
    .border_brush(Brush::new(Color::rgb(0xAA, 0xBB, 0xCC), 0.5))?
    .border_thickness(Thickness::uniform(1.0))?
    .corner_radius(CornerRadius::uniform(4.0))?;
assert_eq!(card.get_background()?, Some(accent));
card.set_border_brush(None)?;
```

Getters return `Result<Option<Brush>>` and setters take `impl Into<Option<Brush>>`,
so `None` clears the property and a `Brush` needs no `Some`. `Color::rgb` is a
`const` opaque-colour constructor, so a consumer can define a palette as
constants.

## Chrome members

The chrome wave allowlists the members that make a control look like part of an
application rather than an unstyled box:

| Projected interface     | Members |
| ----------------------- | ------- |
| `IAvnBorder`            | `Background`, `BorderBrush`, `BorderThickness` (`Thickness`), `CornerRadius` |
| `IAvnPanel`             | `Background` |
| `IAvnTemplatedControl`  | `Background`, `BorderBrush`, `BorderThickness`, `CornerRadius`, `FontSize`, `Foreground` |
| `IAvnTextBlock`         | `FontSize`, `FontWeight`, `Foreground`, `Padding` (`Thickness`), `TextAlignment` |

Each brush member sits on the type that declares it in Avalonia, so `Background`
is published once on `Panel` and once on `TemplatedControl` rather than being
duplicated onto `Grid`, `Button`, `Window` and the rest — a derived interface
that re-declared it would spend a second pair of slots on one property.
`FontWeight` and `TextAlignment` join the IR enums and project as Rust enums with
`TryFrom<i32>`. Rust enums cannot carry two names for one discriminant, so
Avalonia's weight aliases collapse onto the first declared name: write
`FontWeight::DemiBold` rather than `SemiBold`, and `FontWeight::Black` rather
than `Heavy`.

## Control completeness members

The completeness wave allowlists the remaining scalar and enum members that a
consumer needs before it has to reach for XAML, on types the object model already
projects:

| Projected interface   | Members |
| --------------------- | ------- |
| `IAvnContentControl`  | `HorizontalContentAlignment`, `VerticalContentAlignment` |
| `IAvnButton`          | `ClickMode`, `IsDefault`, `IsCancel`, `IsPressed` (read-only) |
| `IAvnToggleButton`    | `IsThreeState` |
| `IAvnListBox`         | `SelectionMode`, `SelectAll()`, `UnselectAll()` |
| `IAvnComboBox`        | `IsDropDownOpen`, `IsEditable`, `MaxDropDownHeight` |

As with every other wave, each member sits on the type that declares it in
Avalonia. `ComboBox` re-declares `HorizontalContentAlignment` and
`VerticalContentAlignment` with `new`, so they stay published once on
`ContentControl` rather than costing a second pair of slots.

`IsPressed` is a read-only direct property that Avalonia raises from its own
input handling, so the ABI publishes `get_is_pressed` and no setter. In safe Rust
a read-only member drops the `get_` prefix and has no builder: `button.is_pressed()?`.

`ClickMode` and `SelectionMode` join the IR enums. `SelectionMode` is a `[Flags]`
enum, and — like `KeyModifiers` — it projects as a plain Rust enum carrying only
the declared modes. A combined value such as `Multiple | Toggle` therefore cannot
be written from Rust, and reading one that XAML set reports
`Error::InvalidEnumValue`. Bitmask-shaped enums need their own representation and
are deliberately left to a later wave.

`Command`, `Flyout`, `ISelectionModel` and `PasswordChar` remain out of scope:
the first three need reference graphs the ABI does not marshal, and `char` is not
a marshalling kind.

## Grid track definitions

`Grid.ColumnDefinitions` and `Grid.RowDefinitions` are collections of
`ColumnDefinition`/`RowDefinition` objects, but Avalonia already has a canonical
textual form for them — the comma-separated length list AXAML writes — and both
collections own both halves of that conversion: `static Parse(string)` and an
overridden `ToString()`. The ABI publishes that string rather than a projected
collection:

| Projected interface | Members |
| ------------------- | ------- |
| `IAvnGrid`          | `ColumnDefinitions`, `RowDefinitions` (both UTF-16 strings) |

```c
AvnHResult (AVN_CALL *get_column_definitions)(IAvnGrid* self, uint16_t** value);
AvnHResult (AVN_CALL *set_column_definitions)(IAvnGrid* self, const uint16_t* value);
```

```rust
grid.set_column_definitions("*,Auto,120")?;
assert_eq!(grid.get_column_definitions()?, "1*,Auto,120");
```

The host wrapper converts on both sides: a get is `ColumnDefinitions.ToString()`
and a set is `ColumnDefinitions.Parse(value)`. This is expressed in the profile
as an ordinary marshalling override to `StringUtf16` on a member whose CLR type
is not `string`; the extractor refuses such an override unless the managed type
declares `static T Parse(string)` and overrides `ToString()`, so the emitter
never guesses at a conversion. No definition object, list interface or factory
slot is minted, which is why this costs `IAvnGrid` four slots and nothing else.

### What the string does and does not carry

The list is **normalising, not byte-preserving**. `*` is shorthand for `1*`, and
whitespace between entries is a separator, so writing `"*, Auto, 120"` and
reading it back reports `"1*,Auto,120"`. A list that has already been normalised
is a fixed point: writing what the getter returned changes nothing. An empty grid
reports an empty string rather than a null pointer, and writing an empty string
clears the tracks — there is no null definition list.

The list carries only each track's `Width`/`Height`, because that is all
`ColumnDefinitions.ToString()` prints. `MinWidth`, `MaxWidth`, `MinHeight`,
`MaxHeight` and `SharedSizeGroup` on an individual definition are **not** in
scope of this ABI, and a set replaces the whole collection, so anything a
previous definition carried beyond its length is dropped rather than merged. That
is a deliberate v1 boundary rather than an oversight: a per-definition surface
needs its own separately named, separately versioned interfaces and is left to a
later wave. A consumer that needs shared size groups should keep those tracks in
AXAML.

A malformed entry fails the call — `Parse` throws and the `HRESULT` carries it
back — rather than being silently dropped or rounded to a nearest length, and the
previous definitions stay in place.

## Image sources

`Image.Source` is an `IImage`, which is a managed *interface*: it has no fields,
no canonical text form and no ABI shape. Wave A projects it as the **source
string** the host resolves into a bitmap rather than as a projected image object:

| Projected interface | Members |
| ------------------- | ------- |
| `IAvnImage`         | `Source` (nullable UTF-16 string), `Stretch`, `StretchDirection`, `BlendMode` |

```c
AvnHResult (AVN_CALL *get_source)(IAvnImage* self, uint16_t** value);
AvnHResult (AVN_CALL *set_source)(IAvnImage* self, const uint16_t* value);
```

```rust
let image = Image::new()?
    .source(r"C:\assets\logo.png")?
    .stretch(Stretch::UniformToFill)?;
assert_eq!(image.get_source()?.as_deref(), Some(r"C:\assets\logo.png"));
```

Four spellings resolve: an absolute filesystem path, a path relative to the
process working directory, a `file://` URI, and an `avares://` or `resm:` URI
resolved through Avalonia's asset loader. Any other scheme — `http` included —
fails the call with `NotSupportedException` rather than silently doing nothing;
fetching over the network is the caller's job, and a byte-buffer entry point is
left to a later wave. An unreadable or undecodable file fails the call too, and
the previous source stays in place.

### What the string does and does not carry

Reading is narrower than writing, and this is the honest boundary of the v1
shape. A `Bitmap` does not remember where it came from, so the host remembers
instead: `AvnImageSource` keeps the string that produced an image in a weak table
and hands it back on read. Consequences:

* An image the ABI set reads back as **the exact string that was written** — not
  a normalised path, and not the bitmap's type name.
* An image the ABI never set reads back as **`null`**, even though the control is
  drawing it. An `Image` whose `Source` came from AXAML, from a style or from
  managed code has no source string to report.
* Writing an empty string or a null **clears** the source; there is no
  "empty path" state.
* Nothing is cached or deduplicated. Setting the same path twice decodes twice.

No `IAvnBitmap`, `IAvnImageSource` or image-list interface is minted, so this
costs `IAvnImage` two slots plus the three enums and nothing else. Projecting a
real image object — with pixel size, DPI, and construction from a byte buffer —
needs its own separately named, separately versioned interface and is left to a
later wave.

## ToolTip

`ToolTip` is projected for its **attached** properties, the same pipeline
`Canvas.Left` and `Grid.Row` use. The statics interface hangs off the factory:

| Statics interface     | Members |
| --------------------- | ------- |
| `IAvnToolTipStatics`  | `Tip` (nullable UTF-16 string), `IsOpen`, `Placement`, `HorizontalOffset`, `VerticalOffset`, `ShowDelay`, `BetweenShowDelay`, `ShowOnDisabled`, `ServiceEnabled` |

```c
AvnHResult (AVN_CALL *get_tip)(IAvnToolTipStatics* self, IAvnControl* target, uint16_t** value);
AvnHResult (AVN_CALL *set_tip)(IAvnToolTipStatics* self, IAvnControl* target, const uint16_t* value);
```

```rust
ToolTip::set_tip(&button, "Save the document")?;
ToolTip::set_show_delay(&button, 250)?;
assert_eq!(ToolTip::get_tip(&button)?.as_deref(), Some("Save the document"));
```

`ToolTip.Tip` is an `object` managed-side so that AXAML can hang a whole control
off it. Over the ABI it carries **text and nothing else**: a tip that is a control
reads back as `null` rather than as its type name, and an empty string clears the
tip rather than storing an empty tooltip. Control-as-tip is a later wave.

`ToolTip` itself is also projected as a control (`IAvnToolTip`, a
`ContentControl`) because the attached-property pipeline requires the owner type
to be in the projection; it adds no members of its own.

## Tabs and trees

| Projected interface | Base | Members it declares |
| ------------------- | ---- | ------------------- |
| `IAvnTabControl`    | `IAvnSelectingItemsControl` | `TabStripPlacement`, `HorizontalContentAlignment`, `VerticalContentAlignment` |
| `IAvnTabItem`       | `IAvnHeaderedContentControl` | `IsSelected` |
| `IAvnHeaderedItemsControl` | `IAvnItemsControl` | `Header` (as `IAvnControl`) |
| `IAvnTreeView`      | `IAvnItemsControl` | `AutoScrollToSelectedItem`, `SelectionMode`, `SelectAll`, `UnselectAll`, `ExpandSubTree`, `CollapseSubTree`, `SelectionChanged` |
| `IAvnTreeViewItem`  | `IAvnHeaderedItemsControl` | `IsExpanded`, `IsSelected`, `Level` (read-only), `Expanded`, `Collapsed` |

`Items` and `SelectedIndex` are **inherited**, not redeclared: `TabControl`
derives from `SelectingItemsControl` so it gets both, and `TreeView` derives from
`ItemsControl` so it gets `Items` but has **no** `SelectedIndex`. `TreeView`'s
own `SelectedItem`/`SelectedItems` are `object`/`IList` and stay in the gap
report; selecting a tree node from Rust is a later wave.

`TabItem.TabStripPlacement` is a `Dock?`. A nullable enum has no ABI shape — the
projection has `NullableBool` but no nullable-enum kind — so it is a gap rather
than a non-nullable `Dock` that silently loses the null. The `TabControl` writes
it anyway, so nothing is lost in practice.

`ExpandSubTree`/`CollapseSubTree` take a projected `IAvnTreeViewItem` and unwrap
it back to the Avalonia object, so a tree node crosses as a real control rather
than an opaque handle. `TreeView.SelectionChanged` is `TreeView`'s own event
rather than the `SelectingItemsControl` one, and like `TreeViewItem.Expanded`
and `TreeViewItem.Collapsed` it carries no payload: the handler is a bare
notification and the consumer reads back whatever it needs.

## Flyouts

A `Flyout` is not a `Control`. `FlyoutBase` derives from `AvaloniaObject`, so
`IAvnFlyoutBase` hangs directly off `IAvnAvaloniaObject`, implements no
`AsControl`, and is never a child of a panel:

| Projected interface   | Base                  | Members it declares |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| `IAvnFlyoutBase`      | `IAvnAvaloniaObject`  | `IsOpen`, `Target` (read-only, as `IAvnControl`), `ShowAt`, `Hide`, `Opened`, `Closed` |
| `IAvnPopupFlyoutBase` | `IAvnFlyoutBase`      | `Placement`, `ShowMode`, `HorizontalOffset`, `VerticalOffset`, `OverlayDismissEventPassThrough`, `Opening`, `Closing` |
| `IAvnFlyout`          | `IAvnPopupFlyoutBase` | `Content` (as `IAvnControl`) |

```c
AvnHResult (AVN_CALL *show_at_with_control)(IAvnFlyoutBase* self, IAvnControl* placement_target);
AvnHResult (AVN_CALL *hide)(IAvnFlyoutBase* self);
```

```rust
let flyout = Flyout::new()?
    .content(Some(&TextBlock::new()?.text("Pick one")?))?
    .placement(PlacementMode::BottomEdgeAlignedLeft)?
    .show_mode(FlyoutShowMode::Transient)?;
flyout.show_at_with_control(&button)?;
assert!(flyout.get_is_open()?);
flyout.hide()?;
```

### Why there is no attached flyout

`FlyoutBase.AttachedFlyout` and `Button.Flyout` are both **gaps**, and this is the
honest boundary of the wave rather than an oversight. The attached-property
pipeline carries scalars and strings only: a COM-valued attached property has no
ABI shape here, and `IAvnControlFactory` mints no `IAvnFlyoutBaseStatics`. What
crosses instead is `ShowAt`, which takes any projected control and unwraps it back
to the Avalonia object, so a flyout still reaches a button — imperatively, which is
what a Rust host is doing anyway. Attaching a flyout declaratively is a later wave.

`ShowAt(Control, bool)` — the show-at-pointer overload — does not cross either;
only the single-argument form does. `Target` is read-only because Avalonia sets it
from `ShowAt`, and a flyout that has never been shown reports `None` rather than a
placeholder.

`PlacementAnchor`, `PlacementGravity` and `PlacementConstraintAdjustment` are
`[Flags]` enums. A combined value has no name, and the projection's enum shape is a
closed set of named values that fails a `try_from` on anything else, so all three
stay in the gap report rather than crossing as an enum that cannot round trip.
`CustomPopupPlacementCallback` and `OverlayInputPassThroughElement` are a delegate
and an `IInputElement`, and neither has an ABI shape.

`Closing` is the only wave B event with a payload. `Cancel` is an in/out field,
exactly like `Control.KeyDown`'s `Handled`: a handler vetoes the close by writing
it back rather than by returning a magic HRESULT.

```rust
flyout.subscribe_closing(|arguments| arguments.cancel = !ready_to_close())?;
```

## Menus as controls

This is the **imperative** menu, distinct from the view-model `NativeMenu` in
[MENUS.md](MENUS.md). A `Menu` is an `ItemsControl` whose items are real projected
controls, built and driven from Rust:

| Projected interface                 | Base                                | Members it declares |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `IAvnMenuBase`                      | `IAvnSelectingItemsControl`         | `IsOpen` (read-only), `Open`, `Close`, `Opened`, `Closed` |
| `IAvnMenu`                          | `IAvnMenuBase`                      | nothing — it inherits all of it |
| `IAvnHeaderedSelectingItemsControl` | `IAvnSelectingItemsControl`         | `Header` (as `IAvnControl`) |
| `IAvnMenuItem`                      | `IAvnHeaderedSelectingItemsControl` | `Icon` (as `IAvnControl`), `IsSelected`, `IsSubMenuOpen`, `StaysOpenOnClick`, `ToggleType`, `IsChecked`, `GroupName`, `Click`, `SubmenuOpened` |

```rust
let menu = Menu::new()?.item(
    MenuItem::new()?
        .header(Some(&TextBlock::new()?.text("File")?))?
        .item(
            MenuItem::new()?
                .header(Some(&TextBlock::new()?.text("Save")?))?
                .toggle_type(MenuItemToggleType::CheckBox)?
                .checked(true)?,
        )?,
)?;
menu.open()?;
assert!(menu.is_open()?);
menu.close()?;
```

`Items` and `SelectedIndex` are **inherited** from `ItemsControl` and
`SelectingItemsControl`; `IsEnabled` is inherited from `Control`. `MenuBase.IsOpen`
has a protected setter managed-side, so the ABI publishes a getter and no setter:
opening a menu goes through `Open`, not through assigning a flag.

`Menu` overrides `Open`/`Close` but declares nothing new, so the flattened vtable
publishes each exactly once, from `IAvnMenuBase`.

What does **not** cross: `MenuItem.Command` is an `ICommand`,
`MenuItem.CommandParameter` is an `object`, and `HotKey`/`InputGesture` are
`KeyGesture`s. All four are gaps. `Click` is the equivalent that does cross, and it
carries no payload — the handler is a bare notification and the consumer reads back
whatever it needs.

## SplitView

| Projected interface | Base                | Members it declares |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| `IAvnSplitView`     | `IAvnContentControl` | `IsPaneOpen`, `DisplayMode`, `PanePlacement`, `OpenPaneLength`, `CompactPaneLength`, `Pane` (as `IAvnControl`), `PaneBackground` (as `IAvnBrush`), `UseLightDismissOverlayMode`, `PaneOpened`, `PaneClosed` |

```rust
let split_view = SplitView::new()?
    .display_mode(SplitViewDisplayMode::CompactOverlay)?
    .pane_placement(SplitViewPanePlacement::Left)?
    .open_pane_length(220.0)?
    .pane(Some(&StackPanel::new()?.child(TextBlock::new()?.text("Pane")?)?))?
    .content(Some(&TextBlock::new()?.text("Body")?))?;
split_view.set_pane_open(true)?;
```

`Pane` is an `object` managed-side and crosses as a control, the same shape
`ContentControl.Content` already uses; `Content` itself is inherited from
`IAvnContentControl`. `PaneOpening`/`PaneClosing` carry a cancellable
`CancelRoutedEventArgs`; they are gaps in this wave, so a pane opens and closes
without a veto point. `PaneTemplate` is an `IDataTemplate` and `TemplateSettings` is
a template-only object; neither crosses.

## Dates and times

`DateTimeOffset` and `TimeSpan` have **no ABI shape** in this projection: there is
no date struct, no epoch integer and no tick count. A date crosses as an ISO-8601
string through the same host-side converter mechanism `Image.Source` uses, and the
parse rules are part of the contract rather than whatever the ambient culture does.

| Projected interface | Base                  | Members it declares |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| `IAvnDatePicker`    | `IAvnTemplatedControl` | `SelectedDate` (nullable), `MinYear`, `MaxYear`, `DayVisible`, `MonthVisible`, `YearVisible`, `DayFormat`, `MonthFormat`, `YearFormat`, `Clear` |
| `IAvnTimePicker`    | `IAvnTemplatedControl` | `SelectedTime` (nullable), `MinuteIncrement`, `SecondIncrement`, `ClockIdentifier`, `UseSeconds`, `Clear` |

```rust
let date_picker = DatePicker::new()?.selected_date("2027-01-15")?;
// Reading is normalising: the round-trip "o" form, not the string that was written.
assert_eq!(
    date_picker.get_selected_date()?.as_deref(),
    Some("2027-01-15T00:00:00.0000000-05:00")
);

let time_picker = TimePicker::new()?.selected_time("17:04")?;
assert_eq!(time_picker.get_selected_time()?.as_deref(), Some("17:04:00"));
```

### What the string does and does not carry

**Dates** (`AvnDateTimeOffset`, `AvnDateTimeOffsetValue`):

* Reading always produces the invariant round-trip `"o"` form,
  `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffK`. It is **normalising, not byte-preserving**: what
  is read back is rarely the exact string that was written.
* Writing accepts exactly these ISO-8601 spellings: `yyyy-MM-dd`, plus optional
  `THH:mm`, `THH:mm:ss` or `THH:mm:ss.fffffff`, plus an optional `Z` or `+hh:mm`
  offset. **Nothing else.** A locale spelling such as `03/09/2026` is ambiguous
  between March 9th and the 3rd of September, so it fails the call rather than
  being resolved by whichever culture happens to be installed.
* A date written without an offset is read as a **local-time** date, which is what
  a `DatePicker` means by "the selected day". `Z` is honoured and read back as
  `+00:00`.
* `SelectedDate` is nullable: a null or empty string **clears** it, and no selection
  reads back as `null` rather than as a default date. `MinYear`/`MaxYear` have no
  absent state, so clearing one fails with `ArgumentNullException` instead of
  quietly meaning "today".

**Times** (`AvnTimeSpan`):

* The wire form is `HH:mm:ss`, 24-hour and invariant — ISO-8601's extended
  *time-of-day* spelling, **not** an ISO-8601 `PnDTnHnMnS` duration. `PT8H15M` fails
  the call.
* Writing also accepts `HH:mm`; reading always produces `HH:mm:ss`. Sub-second
  precision is not part of the wire form and is rejected rather than truncated.
* The value must be within `[00:00:00, 24:00:00)`. Managed code may store any
  `TimeSpan`, so a span outside a day — set from AXAML or from C# — **fails the
  read** instead of being wrapped into a plausible-looking time.

`SelectedDateChanged` and `SelectedTimeChanged` carry `DateTimeOffset?` and
`TimeSpan?` fields. An event payload has no converter hook — field payloads are
scalars and strings the emitter converts itself — so both events are gaps rather
than a payload that silently loses the date. A consumer that needs to observe a
selection polls the property; wiring a converter through event payloads is a later
wave.

`ClockIdentifier` is a plain string that Avalonia validates as `"12HourClock"` or
`"24HourClock"`; an unknown value fails the call because the managed setter throws.

## Versioning of the widened vtables
Nano-COM vtables are flattened, so widening a base type moves every slot of every
interface that inherits from it. Each wave therefore republishes the affected
interfaces at a new `abiVersion` under a fresh IID; the retired IIDs are never
reused. An interface whose flattened vtable is byte-identical keeps its IID, so a
stale consumer that queries for it still gets exactly the contract it was
compiled against.

| Wave     | Widened                                                     | Version | Unchanged |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | --------- |
| Layout   | `IAvnStyledElement`, `IAvnControl` and everything below them | 2 → 3   | `IAvnAvaloniaObject` (2) |
| Chrome   | `IAvnBorder`, `IAvnPanel`, `IAvnTemplatedControl`, `IAvnTextBlock` and everything below them | 3 → 4 | `IAvnAvaloniaObject` (2), `IAvnStyledElement`, `IAvnControl`, `IAvnDecorator` (3) |
| Completeness | `IAvnContentControl`, `IAvnButton`, `IAvnToggleButton`, `IAvnListBox`, `IAvnComboBox` and everything below them | 4 → 5 | `IAvnAvaloniaObject` (2), `IAvnStyledElement`, `IAvnControl`, `IAvnDecorator` (3), `IAvnBorder`, `IAvnPanel`, `IAvnGrid`, `IAvnCanvas`, `IAvnDockPanel`, `IAvnStackPanel`, `IAvnTextBlock`, `IAvnTemplatedControl`, `IAvnItemsControl`, `IAvnSelectingItemsControl`, `IAvnTextBox`, `IAvnRangeBase`, `IAvnSlider`, `IAvnProgressBar` (4) |
| Definitions | `IAvnGrid` alone | 4 → 5 | everything else, including `IAvnPanel`, `IAvnCanvas`, `IAvnDockPanel`, `IAvnStackPanel` (4) |
| New controls A | nothing — seven brand-new interfaces | — | every interface that shipped before, at the version it last published |
| New controls B | nothing — ten brand-new interfaces | — | every interface that shipped before, at the version it last published |
| New controls C | nothing — seven brand-new interfaces | — | every interface that shipped before, at the version it last published |

Nothing in the object model derives from `Grid`, so the definitions wave moves
exactly one interface. `IAvnGrid` has published versions 1–4 and now publishes 5;
all four earlier IIDs are retired for good.

Wave A is the first wave that widens **nothing**. `IAvnImage`,
`IAvnHeaderedItemsControl`, `IAvnTabControl`, `IAvnTabItem`, `IAvnTreeView`,
`IAvnTreeViewItem`, `IAvnToolTip` and `IAvnToolTipStatics` are all new, so they
publish at version 1, and every interface they derive from keeps the IID it last
shipped. A consumer compiled against the definitions wave can keep every
interface pointer it already holds.

Wave B widens nothing either. `IAvnFlyoutBase`, `IAvnPopupFlyoutBase`,
`IAvnFlyout`, `IAvnMenuBase`, `IAvnMenu`, `IAvnHeaderedSelectingItemsControl`,
`IAvnMenuItem`, `IAvnSplitView`, `IAvnDatePicker` and `IAvnTimePicker` are all new
and publish at version 1. The flyout trio hangs off `IAvnAvaloniaObject` rather
than off `IAvnControl`, so it cannot move a control interface even in principle;
`IAvnHeaderedSelectingItemsControl` is inserted below `IAvnSelectingItemsControl`
and nothing that shipped derives from it. Even the wave A interfaces are unmoved,
so a consumer compiled against wave A keeps every control pointer it holds.

`IAvnControlFactory` grew `create_solid_color_brush` and moved from version 1 to
2. Neither the completeness nor the definitions wave adds a factory slot, so it
stayed at 2; wave A gives it a creator per new control plus
`get_tool_tip_statics`, so it moves to 3; wave B gives it a creator per
constructible new type — `Flyout`, `Menu`, `MenuItem`,
`HeaderedSelectingItemsControl`, `SplitView`, `DatePicker` and `TimePicker` — so it
moves to 4. Wave C gives it a creator per constructible new type — `WrapPanel`,
`UniformGrid`, `RelativePanel`, `Viewbox`, `FlexPanel`, `Thumb` and `GridSplitter`
— plus `get_relative_panel_statics`, so it moves to 5. The abstract bases
(`FlyoutBase`, `PopupFlyoutBase`, `MenuBase`) get no creator; they are reachable
by `query_interface` only. `IAvnBrush` is brand new, so it starts at version 1.
The collection interfaces and the event handler interfaces are unchanged, because
they carry interface pointers rather than the widened layouts.

`Decorator` sits between `Control` and `Border`. The chrome wave added members to
`Border`, not to `Decorator`, and nothing was added to `Decorator`'s bases either,
so `IAvnDecorator` keeps the version 3 IID it published with the layout wave even
though `IAvnBorder` moved to 4. `ListBox` and `ComboBox` derive from
`SelectingItemsControl`, not from `ContentControl`, so they moved to 5 for their
own members while `IAvnItemsControl` and `IAvnSelectingItemsControl` stayed at 4.

## Host constraint: same-assembly structs

`Avalonia.Host` builds with `EnableRuntimeMarshalling=true`, so it does **not**
carry `[assembly: DisableRuntimeMarshalling]`. Under that setting the COM
interface source generator only accepts a user-defined struct in a
`[GeneratedComInterface]` signature when the struct is declared in the same
compilation. That is why `ProjectionStructs.g.cs` is emitted directly into
`Avalonia.Host` alongside the generated interfaces. A separate assembly that
wants to declare its own COM interface over these structs must apply
`[assembly: DisableRuntimeMarshalling]` (equivalently, leave
`EnableRuntimeMarshalling` unset so `build/TrimmingEnable.props` applies it).

`IAvnGeometryEcho` / `AvnGeometryEcho` are ABI fixtures in `Avalonia.Host` that
echo every struct back through a real CCW/RCW round trip. They are not part of
the projected object model and are not reachable from `IAvnControlFactory`, so
adding members there never widens a published control vtable.
